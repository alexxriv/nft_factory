# nft_factory

This DAPP runs in Ropsten Ethereum Test Network

This is a simple DAPP which lets you create your own NFT Token representes by a color circle.

This NFT tokens use ERC721 Interface.

To mint a new "color" enter the colors Hex code and click on "Mint"

Your new NFT will be shown in the screen.


This project was built using Truffle, React, NPM and Solidity.
I followed Dapp University tutorial and improved the code to use Solidity 0.8.0 instead of 0.5.0
I also improved functions in client side to optimise it.
